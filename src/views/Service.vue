     <SingleService title="Laser Cutting" image="/img/services/laser.jpg" v-if="$route.params.service == 'laser'">
      <p>Using the Laserdyne BeamDirector System with a KJ704 laser, we employ percussion, trepanning and drill-on-the-fly laser drilling techniques for effusion cooling holes as well as full five-axis laser cutting on pre-formed and machined parts. We can drill holes as small as 0.005 inch in diameter at angles from 15° to 90° degrees to the surface. We can process parts up to 60 inches in diameter and over 48 inches tall.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Setup Time Reductions</li>
        <li>Faster laser parameter development</li>
        <li>Better control of recast and surface finish</li>
        <li>Reduction in production steps</li>
        <li>Delivers a cost-effective manufacturing solution</li>
      </ul>
      <p>At TEM, we deliver consistently smooth, burr-free edges. Accuracies are a tight 0.004 in true position total tolerance for airfoil shapes, cooling holes and trimmed surfaces. Using the Automatic Focus Control (AFC) allows us to maintaining critical focus position while following the contour of the part regardless of slight surface irregularities. With the AFC, all machine axes react to sensing of the part surface, creating unlimited axes corrections with high speed and unmatched sensitivity. AFC allows top machine speeds so productivity is maximized without downtime or scrapped parts.</p>
      <p>Percussion drilling delivers one or more pulses from the laser to a part while the laser beam and part are stationary. More than one pulse may be required depending on the material type and thickness. A variation of percussion drilling is drill-on-the fly, where pulses are delivered to the part by the stationary laser while the part is rotated. The hole placement is a function of rotational speed and laser pulse frequency. If multiple pulses are required, drill-on-the-fly software developed by LASERDYNE engineers is utilized to synchronize the movement of the part to the laser pulses and ensure that multiple pulses are delivered to the exact location required.</p>
